# DiscordWebhookJSON

Welcome to my repo!

This is a Python bot that sends messages through Discord Webhooks.

````EVERYTHING THAT YOU NEED TO KNOW IN THE 'config.json' FILE:````

``"url"``: Webhook's URL (needed)

``"username"``: Webhook's username (needed)

``"message"``: Webhook's message (needed)

``"avatar_url"``: Webhook's avatar (optional)

``"loop"``: You must insert 'True' or 'False' this category or the bot will not function (needed)

Once all of this is complete, simply run the 'main.py' file and the message should send.
